# Threat Composer — Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Deployment
**Threat Composer** is an open-source web application developed by **AWS Labs** for modeling and visualizing cloud threat scenarios. It is built as a React single-page application (SPA) and deploys a two-tier architecture on AWS, with a frontend client layer and backend service/API layer.

## 1. Overview
Deployed the Threat Composer app on AWS using a secure, scalable, and automated DevOps pipeline. Infrastructure was provisioned with **Terraform**, containerized with **Docker**, stored in **ECR**, and deployed to **ECS Fargate**. A **GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline** automated build, **trivy security scan**, and deployment. **Route 53** and **ACM** ensured domain management and HTTPS for a cost-efficient, reliable setup.

## 6. Local Setup

Clone this repository and navigate into the app directory.
You can run the application either with npm (for development) or with Docker (for an isolated runtime).

Using npm: Runs the app in development mode at http://localhost:3000.
```
npm install
npm start
```
Using Docker: If you have Docker installed, you can run the app in a container (no Node.js setup needed). Access it at http://localhost:8080.
```
docker build -t threat-composer-app ./app
docker run -p 8080:80 threat-composer-app
```
